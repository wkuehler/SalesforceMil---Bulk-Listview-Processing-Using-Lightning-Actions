# Bulk Listview Processing Using Lightning Actions

This repo contains the results of our March 19th 2021 military trailblazer office hours call.  During the call, we discussed how to create list view buttons that can run bulk operations on multiple records with a single click.

In our example, we create a list view button that when clicked, sets a specific category and industry for all selected records.

In addition to the update use case, we created an action to delete multiple records.

Call recording can be found in the Office Hours group within the Military Trailblazer community where we discuss both options.
